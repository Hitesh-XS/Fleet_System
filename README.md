#  Real-Time Fleet Route Optimization Platform

A full-stack logistics and fleet management platform that optimizes delivery routes, assigns deliveries intelligently, and provides real-time vehicle tracking using graph algorithms, WebSockets, and interactive maps.

---

## 📌 Overview

Real-Time Fleet Route Optimization Platform is designed to simulate how modern logistics companies such as Amazon, FedEx, Swiggy, and Uber optimize deliveries across multiple vehicles.

The system accepts delivery orders, assigns them to suitable vehicles based on capacity and proximity, computes optimized delivery routes, and visualizes everything on a live interactive map.

The platform is built using **Django**, **React**, **SQLite**, **Leaflet**, and **WebSockets**, with optimization powered by graph algorithms and routing heuristics.
